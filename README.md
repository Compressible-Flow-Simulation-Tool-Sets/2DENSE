# 2DENSE
A 2 Dimensional Euler/Naviers-Stokes Equations solver. 

**2DENSE is still under developing and will be updated instantaneously.**

This is the original code for our paper ["An Adaptive Characteristic-wise Reconstruction WENO scheme for Gas Dynamic Euler
Equations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11288).
